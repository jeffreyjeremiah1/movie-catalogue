# Movie Database

A web application that allows users to browse, search save and delete movies in a catalog. It is built using the React JavaScript library, a movie api which provides the data for the searched movies and flask_sqlalchemy which stores all movie data.

The site could include a list of movies displayed in a grid or a list format, with each movie represented by a thumbnail image and its title. Users could navigate through the list of movies using pagination. When a user clicks on a movie thumbnail, the site displays a detailed view of the movie, including its plot summary, cast and crew information, and ratings. The site also includes a search bar that allows users to search for movies by title or keyword, and an edit button on each movie flash card which takes the user to an page containing a form that allows the user to edit rating of the movie and also give a feedback if they have watched the movie. 

It would provide a user-friendly and visually appealing way for users to discover and learn about movies, and it would offer a rich set of features and functionality for movie lovers.
