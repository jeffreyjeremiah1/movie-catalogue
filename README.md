# Movie Database

A  site made with python that uses a movie API to fetch your top 10 favorite movies through a search bar and save them to a list. Each item displays as a flash card that displays the cover art of the movie, rating and feedback of the user, a button to edit a movie and a button to delete a movie. The edit button takes the user to the edit page which allows the user to edit the rating and feedback of the movie. A database is made using flask_SqlAlchemy that saves the selected movies from the search bar.
